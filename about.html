    My name is Mike Andrianov. I'm the software engineer currently based in Spain.
  </p>
  <p>
    More than a decade ago, I started working on commercial projects, and since then, I have gained extensive experience working on projects of various sizes, from small to large (with over 100 technical staff). For me, the most crucial element of any project is the team. I firmly believe that achieving excellent results is only possible by working in a friendly, respectful, and supportive environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I always strive to write simple, readable, and maintainable code, following the best practices and design principles. Moreover, I have experience in leading projects and teams, and I can assist with technical documentation, presentations, client communication, candidate interviews, mentoring, task decomposition, and learning new programming languages and tools to better serve the team. On a daily basis, I use three programming languages: Ruby, Elixir, and Javascript.
