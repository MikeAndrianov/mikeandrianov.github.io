excerpt: "The advice, which helps to become a better person in different areas."

This advice may seem trivial. Nevertheless this is what helps me to grow.
I keep saying it to myself constantly. Sometimes tempting to delegate the problem to somebody else is great. Especially if I already
tried to solve the problem by my own. Brain wants to save the energy and keeps offering the simpliest most straightforward solution:
instead of resolving the problem, ask somebody else to help.
Don't get me wrong, when working in a team, it's completely fine to ask other people for help, but it's way better for everyone,
if instead of the problem, you bring a something. Even if not a solution, but at least something.

Here is the example. You just opened the issue assigned to you. And it is not everything clear how to solve it. The most straightforward
way is to ask your team lead or more experienced colleage to add more details. It may even look like the right decision:
formally this is not your area of responsibility.
But if you want to become grow, to become better try to force yourself to bring something to the table instead of a problem.
Try to understand what is necessary to implement and why this task was created. Go through the code, think about potential solutions or two.
And bring them to your coleagues.
By simply following this trick you not only reduce load from your peers, but also gain knowledge about your domain and,
what's more importantly, trains your mind to resolve problems instead of giving up.
